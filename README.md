# Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN

This is a Deep Learning project about predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Netowrk Sequential and Functional API.

The model improvement do make the results better, but overall the end results were still not satisfactory. There are still a lot of improvement required, perhaps redoing the project from scratch to get a better flow and results. Further update coming soon.
